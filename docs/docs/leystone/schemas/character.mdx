:::

A **Character** represents a single in game character that is a member of a [Clan](./clan).
Characters are owned by a [User](./user). When an [Event](./event) is recorded, for every **Character** that is part of the [Event](./event),
a [CharacterEventBridge](./characterEventBridge) is created to link the character to the event.
