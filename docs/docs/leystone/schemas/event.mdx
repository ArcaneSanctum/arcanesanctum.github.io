<IncompleteDocWarning/>
:::

An **Event** is created when a user records an [Action](./action). The configuration of the **Event** values and other parameters are based 
on the configuration of the [Action](./action) parameters at the time of recording. If the parent action is modified or deleted, 
corresponding **Events** will remain in their original state.
