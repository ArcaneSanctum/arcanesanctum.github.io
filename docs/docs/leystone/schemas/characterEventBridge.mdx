# Character Event Bridge


:::caution
<IncompleteDocWarning/>
:::

A **CharacterEventBridge** links a [Character](./character) to an [Event](./event).

When an [Event](./event) is recorded, for every [Character](./character) that is part of the [Event](./event),
a **CharacterEventBridge** is created.

This is done to avoid a **Massive Unbounded Array** anti-pattern in the database where a single [Character](./character) could conceivably have thousands of 
[Events](./event) or more. MongoDB enforces a 16MB document limit, and while it is unlikely that many
[Characters](./character) would ever reach this limit, we take this precaution to be safe.
