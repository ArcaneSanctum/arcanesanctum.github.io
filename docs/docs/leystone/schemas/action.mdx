# Action 


:::caution
<IncompleteDocWarning/>
:::

Clans may create any number of **Actions**, each of which represent anything that they deem to be worth recording. Actions can give points toward any number of point categories. 

When an **Action** is recorded, an [Event](./event) is recorded in the database based on the configuration of the **Action** at the time of recording.

The configuration of an **Action** can be changed at any time, however this **will not** retroactively edit old **Events**. This allows clans to have the flexibility to have different 
configurations for an **Action** at different times (ex. Double points over the weekend). Additionally, clans implementing DKP or other similar point-buy systems can modify points 
given by **Actions** without causing unforseen consequences on old [Events](./event).
